Font-awesome - one of the top icon libraries out there and the website just seem incomplete without it. So, I used them in my website as well. So, lets see how to use font-awesome in Gatsby project.

```javascript
// In your gatsby-config.js
plugins: [
  {
    resolve: `gatsby-transformer-remark`,
    options: {
      plugins: [
        `gatsby-remark-prismjs`,
      ]
    }
  }
]
```
