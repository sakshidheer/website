Font-awesome - one of the top icon libraries out there and the website just seem incomplete without it. So, I used them in my website as well. So, lets see how to use font-awesome in Gatsby project.

Create a new project using the following command and select the options as you desire.
```bash
npm init gatsby
```
Go to the your newly created folder with cd command. I gave "add-fon-awesome-in-gatsby" as the name so I will execute the following command

```bash
cd add-fon-awesome-in-gatsby
```

Start your local development server with following command

```bash
npm run develop
```
