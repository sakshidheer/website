# Use font awesome in Gatsby

Hi There! This is my first blog. I created this website using React and Gatsby. I will be sharing few things I learned 
<CopyBlock
      text={jsx}
      language="jsx"
      showLineNumbers={true}
      startingLineNumber={1}
      wrapLines
      theme={dracula}
    />
