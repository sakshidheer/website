Font-awesome - one of the top icon libraries out there and the website just seem incomplete without it. So, I used them in my website as well. So, lets see how to use font-awesome in Gatsby project.

Create a new project using the following command and select the options as you desire.
```bash
npm init gatsby
```
Go to the your newly created folder with cd command. I gave "add-fon-awesome-in-gatsby" as the name so I will execute the following command

```bash
cd add-fon-awesome-in-gatsby
```

Start your local development server with following command

```bash
npm run develop
```
Next step is to open your index.js file and delete the content. Replace the content with the following
```javascript
import * as React from "react"

const IndexPage = () => {
    return (
        <>
            <div>Home</div>
            <div>Author</div>
        </>)
}

export default IndexPage;

```

This is how screen will look now.

import { FontAwesomeIcon } from '@fortawesome/react-fontawesome'
```
