### Function

Function is a block of code that performs some specific task. For example, below is the function that takes a number as argument and return whether the number is prime or not.
```python
def is_num_prime(num):
    if num < 1:
        return False
    is_prime = True
    for index in range(2, num):
        if num % index == 0:
            is_prime = False
            break
    return is_prime
```

All you need to execute the above function is to simply call it as below

```python
is_num_prime(5)
```
### Method

Method is a block of code that is associated with an object. It is basically the set of instructions that are performed on the object

Below is a class named Student and its method called get_age.
```python
```
