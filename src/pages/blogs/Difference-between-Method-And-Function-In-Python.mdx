### Function

Function is a block of code that performs some specific task. For example, below is the function that takes a number as argument and return whether the number is prime or not.
```python
def is_num_prime(num):
    if num < 1:
        return False
    is_prime = True
    for index in range(2, num):
        if num % index == 0:
            is_prime = False
            break
    return is_prime
```
#### How a function is called

All you need to execute the above function is to simply call it by its name as below

```python
is_num_prime(5)
```
### Method

Method is a block of code that is associated with an object. It is basically the set of instructions that are performed on the object

Below is a class named Student and its method called get_age.
```python
from datetime import date
from datetime import timedelta

class Student():
    def __init__(self,id, name, day, month, year):
        self.id = id
        self.name = name
        self.day = day
        self.month = month
        self.year = year
    
    def get_age(self):
        birthday = date(self.year, self.month, self.day)
        today = date.today()
        diff = today - birthday
        return diff.days//365
```

Few things to notice when defining a method:
<>
  <ol>
    <li>The first argument of a method is always self - reference to the object it is attached to</li>
    <li>The method has access to the attributes of the objects its attached to/called on</li>
  </ol>
</>

#### How a method is called

A method is always called on an object, they are always depended on the object.

```python
student = Student(1, "Amit",2, 5, 1996)
student.get_age()
```

### Difference between Function and Method

| Function    | Method      |
| :---        |    :----:   |
| Independent of any object     | Dependent on object       | 
| Called directly by its name                       | Called on some object by its name|
| Can have zero or more arguments        | Has atleast one argument and first argument should be 'self'.Method has access to object's attribute through 'self' on which it is called  | 
| Always defined inside a class | Can be defined anywhere|

This is a one of the first question a beginner asks when they first start learning python. I hope I helped you to explain the difference.
